The COMBO SCRIPT currently has functionality for 2 processes:
At the start, a while loop asks the user what program to run
    1. VISIO NAMING TOOL
        This code is pretty much taken from the older installment of the ComboScript.py file. 
        However, now it only operates to be the Visio naming tool.
        This File is IMPORTED into the Combo Script 2.1 file, (MUST BE IN SAME FOLDER TO PROPERLY RUN)
            Calls 'theGUI()'method, which internally calls:
                startworkbook(), openFiles(), VisioLoop(), visioGuts(), and saveExcel()
                
    2. Combo Script 2.1.py 
        This code is the main file.
        It has two classes, 
            1. Options
                Here are all the methods for openning an excel workbook and sorting out the APS into respective categories
                    Working on importing the sorted info into an Audit excel sheet        
            2. AutoColor
                Here is the GUI for the visio coloring that calls functionality from Options depending on user input
